  The HACC (Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge) is a statewide hackathon that addresses the issues of Hawaii that can be fixed by technology (ex: finding a way for people to communicate with their relatives in prison).  The Governor put State CIO Todd Nacapuy in charge of the event, whom I interned for in the summer.  

  During this internship, I was involved in the HACC.  I was given the task to redo the logo for the HACC.  The CIO knew that I had experience in graphic design, and I was allowed to use anything I wanted, as long as nothing was copyrighted and the logo was appropriate for use. 
  
  From this experience, I repolished the skills I was rusty on in Adobe Illustrator.  I was able to regain certain techniques that I lost, such as tracing objects quickly with precision, blurring certain parts out, and using the smooth tool to smooth out the edges that are not supposed to be sharp.
