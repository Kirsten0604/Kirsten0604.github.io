WetWare Wednesday is an event where people of different majors (mostly ICS) can meet fellow ICS students and also meet scouts looking for new talent.  This is a great way to start building connections, because it will be useful in the future when it comes to job searching.

In this particular event, there was a competition to see who could come up with a design/logo that would fit certain requirements given.  These requirements included that it had to be in relation to the event and it had to be appropriate.  Because this was related to hardware, I decided on a spinning cog with the middle being a computer disk (rainbow color).  I won the competition, and my logo became the new logo of the month for WetWare.

I learned to think on my feet.  I say this because I only knew of the competition the day before the event, not to mention that it was already nighttime and I still had the normal homework to do.  I usually take more time to process and understand things, so it was a new experience to figure out an idea that fast and be able to immediately implement it.
