## What do you think "ethics" is in terms of software engineering?

When most people think about ethics, they believe it is in relation to morals and the difference between right and wrong.  However, I feel this is a grey area, because although these people are partially correct, ethics might not ultimately be from your full point of view.  This means that although ethics stems from your personal morals, another significant part of it are external (influences from others).  To me, I believe they are ways to get around or do certain tasks with evidence to back up your claim.  

## What did you find from reading "The code I'm still ashamed of"?

Naturally, every topic is debatable.  Anyone can find some way to twist words to put blame on someone else, to excuse yourself from facing your fears of the modern day world.  Our task in class was to read "The code I'm still ashamed of" and split up on two sides: ashamed or unashamed.  From this "experiment", I noticed we went from whether the narrator was basing himself off of morals to what ethics truly are and how this 21 year-old developer used it to decide how this incident went.  Although clearly the suicide in the story made the "ashamed" side stand out, the "unashamed" side could rebuddle with almost anything, such as the fact that there was a disclaimer about not using the general information from the website to replace a real doctor's input, or if there was any other data on who benefited, and who's condition made a turn for the worst (a sample of one person does not count as viable evidence).  These are just two of the many examples of ways people change the meaning of ethics for their own benefit, because of their own fears of taking responsibility for their actions (this is where morals integrate into ethics).  In this era, as long as you find some way to back up your actions, you can manipulate others into believing that everything you do is "ethical".

## Final Comments:

Like Danny Weng said, "It could have been worse."  However, I say "It could have been better."  I am completely exaggerating, but I really disliked this lesson.  It is partially because of the problems I ran into, but it was also because I get frustrated when I see errors pop up and my code doesn't work.  I say this because it makes me feel like I failed (when sometimes I actually did it correctly and Meteor just had issues running).  As much as I do enjoy learning new things and faster ways to do a function that I started out doing the hard way, I would not try this again for a while.  After all, can anyone really tell right from wrong
