## What do you think "ethics" is in terms of software engineering?

When most people think about ethics, they believe it is in relation to morals and the difference between right and wrong.  However, I feel this is a grey area, because although these people are partially correct, ethics might not ultimately be from your full point of view.  This means that although ethics stems from your personal morals, another significant part of it are external (influences from others).  To me, I believe they are ways to get around or do certain tasks with evidence to back up your claim.  

## What did you find from reading "The code I'm still ashamed of"?

Naturally, every topic is debatable.  Anyone can find some way to twist words to put blame on someone else, to excuse yourself from facing your fears of the modern day world. :face_with_rolling_eyes:

## Final Comments:

Like Danny Weng said, "It could have been worse."  However, I say "It could have been better."  I am completely exaggerating, but I really disliked this lesson.  It is partially because of the problems I ran into, but it was also because I get frustrated when I see errors pop up and my code doesn't work.  I say this because it makes me feel like I failed (when sometimes I actually did it correctly and Meteor just had issues running).  As much as I do enjoy learning new things and faster ways to do a function that I started out doing the hard way, I would not try this again for a while.  After all, can anyone really tell right from wrong
