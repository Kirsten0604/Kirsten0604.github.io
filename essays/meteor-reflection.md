## Do you feel comfortable with JavaScript?

While I was still searching for a major in my senior year of high school, I was learning JavaScript.  I created a website for my STEM project in relation to ballet and coding.  I believed that programming can help dancers. Doing this project required a lot of thought and preparation.  When people think of coding, they feel it is easy and believe they can just jump into it.  However, it is very complicated, and it takes a very long time to learn the basics, let alone things such as making websites and apps. Although it seems to be an easier spinoff of Java, it is still very complicated in many ways, and it did take me a while to pick it up.  In March of 2016, I took the prep course at DevLeague, known for their coders and programmers.  It took me an entire month to learn how to make websites, and I also had to practice everyday for at least 4 hours to ingrain it in my head.  This was an intense and long class, but it helped me in the long run to create my project and choose my career.  Although I am more comfortable than I was before, I still have a lot to learn.

## How did you feel on the WOD done in class?

I felt the most satisfied when I finished the WOD, and it worked properly.  I feel the WODs are hard, because not only do you have to solve the puzzle and program it correctly, but you also have a time limit, causing you to work under pressure and think on the spot.  It took me a while just to learn the components of JavaScript, as well as the logic when it comes to coding in general.  However, I do feel these WODs will be very useful in the future, because I have learned how to focus better and to practice until I can code certain types of functions easily.  I did make it under 8 minutes, and I will keep improving for the future WODs if I keep practicing.

## Final Comments:

I did enjoy the Danny WOD that I attended.  It was a good practice problem for me, because it helped me prepare for the real WOD.  The TA also explained an example of a good solution promptly after the Danny WOD was finished, which helped me fix my mistakes and understand the logic better. Here is an example of the Danny WOD solution:

```
function Sharky(foods) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let food of foods) {
    if (food == 'fish') {
      total++;
      console.log("Sharky ate some fish and is happy!");
    } else if (food == 'trash') {
      console.log("Sharky ate some trash and is mad!");
    } else if (food == 'other') {
      console.log("Sharky is starving...")
    }
  }

  if (total >= 4) {
    console.log("Sharky is very satisfied");
  } else {
    console.log("Sharky is on a rampage!");
  }
};
```

JavaScript is my go-to language, and I like using it for websites and certain apps.  As long as I keep practicing and asking questions when I need help, I believe I will do fine with the WOD way of learning.
