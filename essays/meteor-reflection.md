## What did you find easy about Meteor?

I am not even sure how to begin answering this question.  Like I said before, Meteor was by far the hardest programming area compared to all the other sections we have covered.  To me, the easiest part in Meteor was completed after I did the same task once previously.  Although this is a rhetorical statement, I say this because all the formatting was the same in relation to the starting instruction.  For example, the WOD this week was to add an event that works like a delete button.  In one of the homework WODs, we had already done the same thing, except it was a function to update an account.  We had this line:

```
Contacts.update(FlowRouter.getParam('_id'));
```

All we needed was to switch the word "update" to "remove" in the digits WOD:

```
Contacts.remove(FlowRouter.getParam('_id'));
```

## What did you find hard about Meteor?

If a meteor hits the Earth, many people would be injured.  Multiply that by infinity, and imagine that impact on my brain.  That is how I feel about running the Meteor program.  Like I stated before, I hate Meteor because of components that are out of my control.  This ranges from installing packages to the amount of damage it does to my computer.  My computer is quite new, and you can hear a "whirring" noise everytime I run the program. It also makes all my other applications run slower than normal.  Although one can argue that my computer could be an older version that has a hard time with meteor, mine is an HP Spectre, which was just let out at the beginning of this year, so that should not be the case.  It takes me half an hour or longer to run Meteor. Sometimes, it doesn’t even run. As I watched the same line blinking in the terminal for hours the first time I ever used Meteor, I promised myself I would never take another look at it again. However, I needed it for this class, so I decided to give it another try. That was a huge bust, because it was even worse this time around. On the bright side, I was entertaining to other peers and my own family, as they watched me pace the room muttering about my first world problems.  I followed all the instructions, and I watched all the tutorials needed, so I guess I was just unlucky in my run-in with Meteor.  In the end, I gave up, wrote the entire code and left meteor running until the end, hoping my code would work the first time. 

## Final Comments:

Like Danny Weng said, "It could have been worse."  However, I say "It could have been better."  Meteor is the bane of my existence. Excuse my negativity, but I never liked Meteor from the start.  I am completely exaggerating, but I really disliked this lesson.  It is partially because of the problems I ran into, but it was also because I get frustrated when I see errors pop up and my code doesn't work.  I say this because it makes me feel like I failed (when sometimes I actually did it correctly and Meteor just had issues running).  I probably just had a bad experience with it, but it was so terrible to the point where I would get irritated if someone even mentioned the word “meteor” (even if it was related to astrology). I hope never to use Meteor again, but I guess I can always use the practice, as programmers will eventually have to work with machines and editors they dislike.  As much as I do enjoy learning new things and faster ways to do a function that I started out doing the hard way, I would not try this again for a while.
