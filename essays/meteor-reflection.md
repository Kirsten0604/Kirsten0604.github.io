## What did you find easy about Meteor?

I am not even sure how to begin answering this question.  Like I said before, Meteor was by far the hardest programming area compared to all the other sections we have covered.  To me, the easiest part in Meteor was completed after I did the same task once previously.  Although this is a rhetorical statement, I say this because all the formatting was the same in relation to the starting instruction.  For example, the WOD this week was to add an event that works like a delete button.  In one of the homework WODs, we had already done the same thing, except it was a function to update an account.  We had this line:

```
Contacts.update(FlowRouter.getParam('_id'));
```

All we needed was to switch the word "update" to "remove" in the digits WOD:

```
Contacts.remove(FlowRouter.getParam('_id'));
```

## What did you find hard about Meteor?

If a meteor hits the Earth, many people would be injured.  Multiply that by infinity, and imagine that impact on my brain.  That is how I feel about running the Meteor program.  Like I stated before, I hate Meteor because of components that are out of my control.  This ranges from installing packages to the amount of damage it does to my computer.  My computer is quite new, and you can hear a "whirring" noise everytime I run the program. It also makes all my other applications run slower than normal.  Although one can argue that my computer could be an older version that has a hard time with meteor, mine is an HP Spectre, which was just let out at the beginning of this year, so that should not be the case.  I followed all the instructions, and I watched all the tutorials needed, so I guess I was just unlucky in my run-in with Meteor.
