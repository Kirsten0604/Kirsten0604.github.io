## Run it at the end and hope for the best!

Meteor is the bane of my existence.  Excuse my negativity, but I never liked Meteor from the start.  Meteor is just another way to test out your programs.  Although I do appreciate learning it, I also don't quite understand what makes it easier than other program runners, such as http server or live server.  Meteor actually takes a horrible amount of time to run.  I have one of the newest editions in relations to a computer (HP Spectre), but yet it takes me half an hour or longer to run Meteor.  Sometimes, it doesn't even run.  As I watched the same line blinking in the terminal for hours the first time I ever used Meteor, I promised myself I would never take another look at it again.  However, I needed it for this class, so I decided to give it another try.  That was a huge bust, because it was even worse this time around.  On the bright side, I was entertaining to other peers and my own family, as they watched me pace the room muttering about my first world problems.  In the end, I gave up, wrote the entire code and left meteor running until the end, hoping my code would work the first time.

## Packaging?

Packaging was almost as bad as running the actual program.  Adding and deleting certain files took a long time as well.  It took all my willpower not to just close my computer and go eat or sleep.  In fact, it took more effort to install packages than to type the actual code needed in the WODs.  I say this because I can control the code, so if the program doesn't run, my logic was not sound and that is my fault.  On the other hand, I cannot control how fast Meteor will run with the already given commands, and when I cannot control variables like that, I feel annoyed, because I have the potential to fail when I am unable to fix the issue on my own.  Every time I would read "Meteor npm install ..." I would feel like running away from my own computer immediately, because I already know what will take most people "only 20 seconds" will take me at least an hour or two.

## Final Comments:

Overall, I would never use Meteor.  In fact, I would probably uninstall it, because of how much I despise it.  Most of my issues were with time complexity.  Everything would take too long to install or run, and if it went too slow, I would try to restart it and still fail to come up with anything.  I probably just had a bad experience with it, but it was so terrible to the point where I would get irritated if someone even mentioned the word "meteor" (even if it was related to astrology).  I hope never to use Meteor again, but I guess I can always use the practice, as programmers will eventually have to work with machines and editors they dislike.
