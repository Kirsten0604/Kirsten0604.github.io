## Overview

The problem: Sometimes, UHM students who are from the mainland do not know what kind of activities they can do at UH during their free time besides studying.  This is the same for locals, who get bored because they have done everything they can think of.

The solution: FlashFinder is a program where UH students and can find activities to do with others on the island.  Students can set up notifications when a new spot or activity is posted.  Students can also narrow searches down by adding tags based on their likes and dislikes.

In order to access the information, students and admins log in with their UH ID.

## Mockup Page Ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:

- Search page
- Instruction page (in case student needs help)
- Login page
- Profile page
- Admin page
- Map page (location)
- About pages (for on-campus activities)
- Request Forum page

## Use Case Ideas

- New user starts at Instruction page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. 
- Admin goes to Instruction page, logs in, gets profile page, edits site.
- User goes to Search or Map page, logs in, looks for activities of interest.
- If user finds new location, sends a request on the Request Forum page for the Admin to approve to be added.

## Beyond the Basics

- Notify admins when there is new activity or a new request so they can review for appropriateness.
- Allow students to rate activities.
- Allows comments from students.  If inappropriate, Admin should have access to deletion.
