## Copy Pasta

In Computer Science, most professors and colleagues would reprimand you for taking an already-seen code as well as most likely making sure you never get a job for these actions.  However, in certain cases it is feasible to do this taboo.  Design patterns are a common example of this.  Creating a template that others can use and modify to create derivations of higher quality are essential ways of learning.  Although this might seem contradictory to the norm, most software developers use other works as a reference to their own piece.  In other words, people must see other types of work to base their own work off of.  In this modern day, most pieces are taken from an origin of some sort.

## How did ICS 314 affect your opinion of templates?



## Final Comments:

I have a very specific standpoint when it comes to ethics.  Call me naive, but I know most people (if not everyone) has a conscience, a sort of guide to determine right from wrong.  From this, you can gather that I stand by the fact that your personal morals should affect your choices, and you should know what is truly ethical.  Although there are peers who will pressure you into making mistakes, or anyone has a thought on your decision, the final conclusion is ultimately up to you.  From my perspective, the whole point of becoming a developer is to create new ideas and thoughts that will benefit the society as a whole, and you have to stand by what you do in order to succeed.  There were many arguments in class that they would have programmed the code in that situation anyway, just because of extrinsic motivators such as money and the fact that you even have a job.  Some argued that no matter what choice you made, you would be punished either way.  So if that is the case, then shouldn't you take matters into your own hands and decide what you feel is right?
