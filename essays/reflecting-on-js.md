## Do you feel comfortable with JavaScript?

While I was still searching for a major in my senior year of high school,   

## 

Coming to the conclusion of majoring in Computer Science is not what the typical person would expect.  In fact, I had no thought of doing this major, nor did I even know what coding was in the past.  I was originally going to dance for a couple of years and go to college later so I could study medicine and become a surgeon.  Unfortunately, I injured myself to the point where I couldn’t dance anymore, and my career flew out the window, not to mention my new appearing fear of the sight of blood (I could not become a surgeon under these circumstances).  I was in senior year of high school, and I needed to find out what my future plans were before I graduated.  Once again, my mom indirectly came to the rescue, having taken a basic coding class at Devleague and making me do the same.  I picked up the logic fast, and I was able to successfully make websites and simple programs quickly in Javascript.  Therefore, I had decided on my major.

## Final Comments:

In conclusion, computers are important aspects of our everyday lives, whether we are using one or we aren’t.  Computers are connected with everything a person uses, whether it is something technical like a program or a normal item such as a tube of toothpaste.  Without computers, it would be very hard for anyone to survive in the modern day.
